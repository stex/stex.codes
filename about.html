    <h2>Ahoy, glad you made it here!</h2>

    <p>
      I'm Stefan Exner (hence the domain name), currently working as IT freelancer (Development, Consulting, whatever is
      needed) and living in Hamburg, Germany.
    </p>

    <p>
      With 4 older brothers who all ended up somewhere in computer science or architecture,
      there might have been a slight nudge to go into the same direction - I've seen pictures
      of 3-year-old me with a computer keyboard. My starting point with programming was
      QuickBASIC at the age of 11, followed by Pascal, Delphi, VB.net, PHP, ... until I fell in love
      with Ruby in 2008 due to its code aesthetic. Hard to describe, but I'm sure fellow
      Rubyists understand the beauty of good Ruby code ðŸ˜Œ
    </p>

    <p>
      My favourite work could be described as simply helping people solve their technology related problems.
      This can include identifying the actual needs with them, choosing a proper technical stack to build on, developing
      a corresponding system myself,
      translating business requirements into technical ones and/or supporting an existing team.
      I love building MVPs and agile, iterative development. Start with something small and let it grow based on the
      respective circumstances.
    </p>

    <p>
      And to get a few buzzwords out of the way, here's a excerpt of what I've worked with and as
      in the recent past:

    <p>
      Apart from work, I love making music (Piano, Guitar, Violin, Singing),
      audio books ("HÃ¶rspiele") and occasionally doing stupid voices (which lead to a role on
      "Die drei Fragezeichen" - a dream come true for me).
      Oh, and I started with {{ "Postcrossing" | external_link: "https://www.postcrossing.com" }}
      again after a few years of hiatus to see a bit more of the world in times of Covid.

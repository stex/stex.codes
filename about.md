## Ahoy, glad you made it here!

I'm Stefan Exner (hence the domain name), currently working as Digital Solution Architect 
and living in Hamburg, Germany.

I've always been interested in everything regarding computers 
(that's what happens with 4 older brothers who all ended up in 
computer science or architecture I guess) and started 
with programming when I was around 11.

While I worked with many different programming languages over the time 
(started with Quick Basic back then...), I fell in love with Ruby in 2008 
due to its code aesthetic. Hard to describe, but I'm sure fellow 
Ruby developers understand the beauty of good Ruby code 😌  

While I think I'm a good developer, I noticed over time that I'm more interested
in helping other people finding solutions for their technical problems
and keeping an overview over complex architectures. 
I'm currently trying to move more and more into Architect or Technical Consulting roles. 

Apart from development, I love making music (Piano, Guitar, Violin, Singing),
audio books ("Hörspiele") and occasionally doing stupid voices (which lead to a role on
"Die drei Fragezeichen" - a dream come true for me).

## Past and Present Work

  </small>
</h3>

After the insolvency of my previous company, the intellectual property was 
bought by an investor who decided to continue development with a very small team. 
I was asked to join said team and decided to do so for a certain time as I 
still believe in the idea of Lokalportal as base of several possible products. 
Since I've been there since the beginning, I still felt a bit responsible for it as well.

Due to the current circumstances, I am doing a lot of backend development work again, 
including containerization, server administration and CI work - basically everything that's
not considered to be purely frontend and needs to be done.

The role is supposed to evolve into more of technical consulting again,
being it integration of our products into external systems or within the new 
investor's ecosystem.

  </small>
</h3>

Lokalportal is a mix of a social network and publishing platform. 
It started with a closed neighborhood network (like nextdoor), but 
evolved into an open news and community building platform.

The title pretty much sums it up. After having started the company's backend 
in Ruby on Rails as a freelancer while finishing my Master's degree, 
I got an offer to work full-time for them. 
When I joined the company in 2016, we were just 5 people.

Since I knew the project since the beginning and generally had broad knowledge 
both of the product and its technology, I had to fill multiple roles as the company grew: 

* Backend development
* Leading the backend team (including job interviews, etc.)
* Keeping an architectural overview over "Lokalportal" and various side projects
* Helping discover problems that might affect multiple teams and get them to find a 
  common solution / keep each other in the loop regarding development.
* Provide advice to the product owner regarding the technical feasibility and 
  time/effort of new features

While all of these roles were important for the company, 
it was too much for one person. I never felt like I did enough for each of them and 
felt bad e.g. for not spending enough time with the backend team when working on 
something across teams.

In 2019 and with almost 20 developers, the founders and I decided to assign me 
the role of *Head of Technology Innovation* which meant I could concentrate on 
a high level view of all of the company's projects without being too 
involved in daily development business. I'd describe it as a mixture of 
internal consulting, research and POC development.

Unfortunately, the company went into insolvency in early 2020 due to the 
situation in German publishing houses during Covid19.

Technical Projects during this time include:

* The Ruby on Rails API serving lokalportal.de
* An admin application (Rails and Vue 2)
* A system to automatically create localized ads on Facebook and 
  Google Adwords based on content from different sources (e.g. posts from Lokalportal)
* On-the-fly mapping of external content to a generic import format 
  using Google Cloud Functions

<h3>
  Freelance Work while studying Computer Science (Master's Degree)
  <br />
  <small>
    <em>2009-2016</em> at <a href="https://www.uni-kiel.de/de/" target="_blank">CAU Kiel</a>
  </small>
</h3>

Even though studying was my main job during this time, I started working 
as a freelance developer to gain more professional experience and be more 
prepared after getting my degree.

The project I'm most proud of during this time is 
the {{ "iLearn e-learning platform" | external_link: "https://ilearn.informatik.uni-kiel.de" }} 
that's still in use to this day for most computer science lectures and 
therefore by all attending students.

The system started as a bachelor project by a group of students who didn't have 
a lot of previous experience in web development or projects of this size. After the 
students finished their studies, the university searched for someone who 
could continue development on it.

In the following time, I rewrote most of the application to give it a 
more modern look and feel (including AJAX content for the first time). Yes, it's 
bootstrap with a few own extensions, but I've unfortunately never been much of a 
designer and it looked good enough 😅

While the iLearn system is still in use, it might be replaced by a 
commercial e-learning platform in the future. I might be able to open-source 
the code in the future as I don't know of any other platform yet that's so 
specialized for STEM lectures and exercises.

Apart from development work, I was booked as lecturer for the 
{{ "IQSH" | external_link: "https://www.schleswig-holstein.de/DE/Landesregierung/IQSH/iqsh_node.html" }} 
and helped training teachers to become computer science teachers in a 
practical module involving Lego Mindstorms robots. This is something I'm still 
involved in to the present day.

</h3>

While Visrez is specializing on 3D floorplans nowadays, the company 
was mainly developing booking engines for hotels and event venues in Ireland back then.

After a few weeks of internship at the company, I started working full-time 
on the main project which was a monolithic booking engine written in Ruby on 
Rails that was already in use by various venues all over Ireland.

My work included extending the application with a better backend and skin system 
(based on Shopify's {{ "Liquid Template Engine" | external_link: "https://shopify.github.io/liquid" }}) 
while working directly with our customers.

I still worked for them now and then during my time as a freelancer.

## Experience

### Ruby on Rails

I started with Rails development in 2008 and it's the language/framework combination 
I know most about.

Over the years, wrote several gems, including the 
{{ "POC for a STM library for Ruby" | external_link: "https://github.com/Stex/petra" }} which 
was part of my Master's Thesis.

Examples of my work can be found on my 
{{ "Github Profile" | external_link: "https://github.com/stex" }}

I've been a speaker at the Ruby Unconf in Hamburg 
in {{ "2018" | external_link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGo1dL8i4Jo" }} 
and {{ "2019" | external_link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFw9__q0Weg" }} 
(both times spontaneously with a presentation built in the night before, but enough
people still voted for it 😅) and try to attend the Ruby Usergroup regularly.

### Javascript (Frameworks)

I started with Javascript a the time of IE6 and the Prototype framework. 
When jQuery came around, it was like a miracle regarding how fast and easy 
everything had become 🦄. I had the same feeling again with ES6, Javascript
had become a real and usable language.

For a few years, I was mainly working with Javascript in the context for Rails, 
meaning coffescript and jQuery. That was before bundlers like Webpack or Parcel came
around and the asset pipeline was working great. 

After joining Lokalportal, I got myself into Angular (1.5 at the time) and 
later Vue 2 which I used a lot alongside Rails for dynamic components. 
I also worked on standard node projects, e.g. in Google Cloud Functions.

I don't see myself as an expert in building a big SPA in either framework, 
but I know how they work and will find my way around after a short time.

### Server Administration / CI / ...

While I'm definitely not an expert in server administration,
I usually get where I need to with a bit of help from Google.
I love working with Docker due to its encapsulation,
scalability and the general feeling of creating something clean and tidy.
With `docker-compose`/`docker stack`/`docker-machine`,
even complex microservice architectures became manageable again.

I also have experience in building complex CI pipelines based on Docker, e.g. in Gitlab-CI.

Example work: This website runs in Docker
behind {{ "`nginx-proxy`" | external_link: "https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy" }} on an own vServer,
each push triggers a build through Github Actions and deployment is done via webhook.

### Other Languages

I worked with a lot of languages over the years and studying computer science
led to broad overview over many different programming concepts (functional, logical, etc).

In the end, development is development. When you start a new language, you just have to
make sure you understand the core principles behind it and try to get into
best practices. You can't be an expert in everything, but you can work with everything.

An incomplete list of other languages I worked with in the past:

**Delphi 7**

A complete client/server office management solution including employee management, 
orders, time sheets, etc.  
It's still in use and works to the current day which is pretty mind-blowing and speaks
for Windows 10's compatibility with old software.

Also, various smaller applications which I just found out are still available on freeware.de.

**PHP / MySQL** 
  
Various websites, the usual starting point for web development back then.  
Later wordpress customizations.

**Java, C**
  
Mostly as part of my studies, but also later when working with Lego Mindstorms and the
{{ "leJOS Firmware" | external_link: "http://www.lejos.org/" }} 
or {{ "NXC" | external_link: "http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nbc/" }}

**Haskell, Erlang, Prolog**

Since my master's degree was in declarative and distributed programming, I came
into close contact with a lot of programming languages that aren't used wildly outside
the academic context. Out of all of them, I love Erlang's concepts (not its syntax!)
and am glad that Elixir transferred it into modern times.

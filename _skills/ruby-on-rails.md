I started with Rails development in 2008 and it's the language/framework combination
I know most about.

Over the years, wrote several gems, including the
{{ "POC for a STM library for Ruby" | external_link: "https://github.com/Stex/petra" }} which
was part of my Master's Thesis.

Examples of my work can be found on my
{{ "Github Profile" | external_link: "https://github.com/stex" }}

I've been a speaker at the Ruby Unconf in Hamburg
in {{ "2018" | external_link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGo1dL8i4Jo" }}
and {{ "2019" | external_link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFw9__q0Weg" }}
(both times spontaneously with a presentation built in the night before, but enough
people still voted for it ðŸ˜…) and try to attend the Ruby Usergroup regularly.

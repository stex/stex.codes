While I'm definitely not an expert in server administration, I usually get where I need to with a bit of help from Google.

I love working with Docker due to its encapsulation, scalability and the general feeling of creating something clean and tidy.
With `docker-compose`/`docker stack`/`docker-machine`, even complex microservice architectures became manageable again.

I also have experience in building complex CI pipelines based on Docker, e.g. in Gitlab-CI or Github Actions.
Automating large parts of the "annoying" or repetitive aspects of a developer's work feels great.

I worked with a lot of languages over the years and studying computer science
led to broad overview over many different programming concepts (functional, logical, etc).

In the end, development is development. When you start a new language, you just have to
make sure you understand the core principles behind it and try to get into
best practices. You can't be an expert in everything, but you can work with everything.

An incomplete list of other languages I worked with in the past:

**Delphi 7**

A complete client/server office management solution including employee management,
orders, time sheets, etc.
It's still in use and works to the current day which is pretty mind-blowing and speaks
for Windows 10's compatibility with old software.

Also, various smaller applications which I just found out are still available on freeware.de.

**PHP / MySQL**

Various websites, the usual starting point for web development back then.
Later wordpress customizations.

**Java, C**

Mostly as part of my studies, but also later when working with Lego Mindstorms and the
{{ "leJOS Firmware" | external_link: "http://www.lejos.org/" }}
or {{ "NXC" | external_link: "http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nbc/" }}

**Haskell, Erlang, Prolog**

Since my master's degree was in declarative and distributed programming, I came
into close contact with a lot of programming languages that aren't used wildly outside
the academic context. Out of all of them, I love Erlang's concepts (not its syntax!)
and am glad that Elixir transferred it into modern times.

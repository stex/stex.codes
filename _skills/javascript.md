I started with Javascript a the time of IE6 and the Prototype framework.
When jQuery came around, it was like a miracle regarding how fast and easy
everything had become ðŸ¦„. I had the same feeling again with ES6, Javascript
had become a real and usable language.

For a few years, I was mainly working with Javascript in the context for Rails,
meaning coffescript and jQuery. That was before bundlers like Webpack or Parcel came
around and the asset pipeline was working great.

After joining Lokalportal, I got myself into Angular (1.5 at the time) and
later Vue 2 which I used a lot alongside Rails for dynamic components.
I also worked on standard node projects, e.g. in Google Cloud Functions.

I don't see myself as an expert in building a big SPA in either framework,
but I know how they work and will find my way around after a short time.

Starting with my fullstack work at {{ "Snaque" | external_link: "https://snaque.com" }},
I moved to using stimulus for most dynamic content instead of Vue and love it so far ðŸ™‚

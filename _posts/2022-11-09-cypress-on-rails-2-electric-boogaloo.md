Today I held an updated version of my [Cypress on Rails]({% post_url 2020-12-09-cypress-on-rails-talk %}) talk
at the {{ "Hamburg Ruby UserGroup" | external_link: "https://hamburg.onruby.de/" }}.

The talk covers an introduction to Cypress, how to communicate with a Rails server from Cypress
to e.g. generate test data with `factory_bot` and a way to run Cypress tests in CI
with spinning up the Rails application as a service in Gitlab CI or Github Actions.

We had a great discussion about responsibility for e2e tests (is it the backend team? is it the frontend team? why not both?)
and whether e2e tests are needed at all when backend/frontend specific tests exist.

{{ "The slides" | external_link: "https://github.com/stex/cypress_demo/blob/main/pitch/cypress-on-rails.pdf" }} can be found over at Github together with a {{ "demo project" | external_link: "https://github.com/stex/cypress_demo" }} that contains

* a Rails 7 application with Rodauth and Turbo Frames and ActionText usage
* a small Cypress test suite
* Dockerfiles for both the application and Cypress
* a Github Actions configuration to build the Docker images and run the Cypress tests with the Rails Application as Service container

All image were generated by {{ "DALL-E" | external_link: "https://labs.openai.com/" }}, there are a few more in the `pitch` folder that were not used if you're interested ðŸ™‚

A talk about how to replace Capybara with {{ "cypress.io" | external_link: "https://cypress.io" }} for E2E tests
while maintaining all the nice features like using `FactoryBot` to generate test data on-the-fly. 
Held on the December meeting of the {{ "Hamburg Ruby UserGroup" | external_link: "https://hamburg.onruby.de/" }}.

As this is an interesting topic, I'll probably write a proper blog post about it in the future.  
Until then, I'll provide my slides and the demo application I created for the talk here.
It contains both capybara and cypress examples and should give a good introduction on
how to start using cypress with Rails.

While Visrez is specializing on 3D floorplans nowadays, the company
was mainly developing booking engines for hotels and event venues in Ireland back then.

After a few weeks of internship at the company, I started working full-time
on the main project which was a monolithic booking engine written in Ruby on
Rails that was already in use by various venues all over Ireland.

My work included extending the application with a better backend and skin system
(based on Shopify's {{ "Liquid Template Engine" | external_link: "https://shopify.github.io/liquid" }})
while working directly with our customers.

I still worked for them now and then during my time as a freelancer.

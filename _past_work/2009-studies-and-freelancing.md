Even though studying was my main job during this time, I started working
as a freelance developer to gain more professional experience and be more
prepared after getting my degree.

The project I'm most proud of during this time is
the {{ "iLearn e-learning platform" | external_link: "https://ilearn.informatik.uni-kiel.de" }}
that's still in use to this day for most computer science lectures and
therefore by all attending students.

The system started as a bachelor project by a group of students who didn't have
a lot of previous experience in web development or projects of this size. After the
students finished their studies, the university searched for someone who
could continue development on it.

In the following time, I rewrote most of the application to give it a
more modern look and feel (including AJAX content for the first time). Yes, it's
bootstrap with a few own extensions, but I've unfortunately never been much of a
designer and it looked good enough ðŸ˜…

While the iLearn system is still in use, it might be replaced by a
commercial e-learning platform in the future. I might be able to open-source
the code in the future as I don't know of any other platform yet that's so
specialized for STEM lectures and exercises.

Apart from development work, I was booked as lecturer for the
{{ "IQSH" | external_link: "https://www.schleswig-holstein.de/DE/Landesregierung/IQSH/iqsh_node.html" }}
and helped training teachers to become computer science teachers in a
practical module involving Lego Mindstorms robots. This is something I'm still
involved in to the present day.

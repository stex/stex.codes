Lokalportal is a mix of a social network and publishing platform.
It started with a closed neighborhood network (like nextdoor), but
evolved into an open news and community building platform.

The title pretty much sums it up. After having started the company's backend
in Ruby on Rails as a freelancer while finishing my Master's degree,
I got an offer to work full-time for them.
When I joined the company in 2016, we were just 5 people.

Since I knew the project since the beginning and generally had broad knowledge
both of the product and its technology, I had to fill multiple roles as the company grew:

  * Backend development
  * Leading the backend team (including job interviews, etc.)
  * Keeping an architectural overview over "Lokalportal" and various side projects
  * Helping discover problems that might affect multiple teams and get them to find a
  common solution / keep each other in the loop regarding development.
  * Provide advice to the product owner regarding the technical feasibility and
  time/effort of new features
  * Do all the other stuff that is needed to keep development working and that's only
  noticed when it's not done anymore.

While all of these roles were important for the company,
it was too much for one person. I never felt like I did enough for each of them and
felt bad e.g. for not spending enough time with the backend team when working on
something across teams.

In 2019 and with almost 20 developers, the founders and I decided to assign me
the role of *Head of Technology Innovation* which meant I could concentrate on
a high level view of all of the company's projects without being too
involved in daily development business. I'd describe it as a mixture of
internal consulting, research and POC development.

Unfortunately, the company went into insolvency in early 2020 due to the
situation in German publishing houses during Covid19.

Technical Projects during this time include:

* The Ruby on Rails API serving lokalportal.de
* An admin application (Rails and Vue 2)
* A system to automatically create localized ads on Facebook and
Google Adwords based on content from different sources (e.g. posts from Lokalportal)
* On-the-fly mapping of external content to a generic import format
using Google Cloud Functions
* A prototype for Google Assistant integration for Lokalportal (including Google Home)
* Building a complex

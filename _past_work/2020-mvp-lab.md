After the insolvency of my previous company, the intellectual property was
bought by an investor who decided to continue development with a very small team.
I was asked to join said team and decided to do so for a certain time as I
still believe in the idea of Lokalportal as base of several possible products.
Since I've been there since the beginning, I still felt a bit responsible for it as well.

Due to the circumstances, I've been doing a lot of backend development work again,
including containerization, server administration and CI work - basically everything that's
not considered to be purely frontend and needs to be done.

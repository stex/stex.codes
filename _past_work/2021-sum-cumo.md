While working as a freelancer at {{ "sum.cumo" | external_link: "https://sumcumo.com" }}, I was deployed to a newly built team
at {{ "freeyou" | external_link: "https://www.freeyou.ag" }}. Our job was to extend all claims related aspects of the
existing insurance platform, the underlying Rails engine and various additional gems.

My work included refactoring/streamlining the existing engine code and extending it by various helpers to keep
future code clean and DRY. Apart from pure development, I worked closely with the PO and designer and on improving inter-team communication
and the team's agile workflow.

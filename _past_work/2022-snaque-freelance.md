Snaque was/is a startup with the goal to introduce a way for casual readers to access articles
currently completely locked behind paywalls. To do so, the idea was to get the user to interact with
a Tinder-like ad (swiping, answering questions) and the corresponding advertiser paying the publishing house
for the unlocked article. There's more behind it, if you're interested, please visit the company website!

My initial task was to build a backend application to handle the ad process, meaning the delivering of
swipeable ads to the client, built by one of the company's founders.

The scope was enhanced over time to also cover an ad manager / editor and dashboards for various campaigns
as well as setting up the necessary server infrastructure, monitoring and metrics.
